Ongoing practice using Mass Effect Trilogy in Java

ALL COPYRIGHT BELONGS TO BIOWARE AND EA

I am simply using the trilogy as a refernce so I don't have to create all new characters, ships, etc.

If you haven't played the trilogy, I highly recommend that you do.

Changes will occur in each iteration

Thanks

Ash
